CSS Basic Layout should take the most time here. |

## Code Snippet

Doing the flip cards was a fun excercise and while it could use some DRY and refactoring I think it was quite a project figuing it how to best do it.  I started with trying to do it in Css with transitions and flipping the axis but it wasn't as simple as I wanted it to be and instead I decided to make this my Javascript element and used innertext to change what was in the box. 

const flipBoxInner = document.querySelector(".flip-box-front");
const flipBoxInner1 = document.querySelector(".flip-box-front1");
const flipBoxInner2 = document.querySelector(".flip-box-front2");
const flipBoxInner3 = document.querySelector(".flip-box-front3");

// when someone hovers over the card flip to the back, when they move off of it, change it back to the title
flipBoxInner.addEventListener('mouseover', function() {
  //change text to backside of the card
    flipBoxInner.textContent = "A fun game featuring prompts and alerts.  Built in a single object & features Ryan Gossling; who provides postive affermations as players guesses the secret number";   

});
flipBoxInner.addEventListener('mouseleave', function() {
  //change back to the front
    flipBoxInner.textContent = 'Hey Girl! Guess My Number!';
    }
);

flipBoxInner1.addEventListener('mouseover', function() {
   //change text to backside of the card
    flipBoxInner1.textContent = "Showcasing the work with OpenWeather's Api this program tells the end-user what the weather is like for a particular named city";
    }
);
flipBoxInner1.addEventListener('mouseleave', function() {
 //change back to the front
    flipBoxInner1.textContent = "How should I complain about the weather?";
    }
);

flipBoxInner2.addEventListener('mouseover', function() {
  //change text to backside of the card
    flipBoxInner2.textContent = "Inspired by the classic children's game memory. Showcases work with Javascript and Randomization";
    }
);
flipBoxInner2.addEventListener('mouseleave', function() {
   //change back to the front
    flipBoxInner2.textContent = "Programmers Memory Game";
    }
);

flipBoxInner3.addEventListener('mouseover', function() {
//change text to backside of the card
    flipBoxInner3.textContent = "A surefire way to make you smile, this project worked with connecting APIs and sound controls";
    }
);
flipBoxInner3.addEventListener('mouseleave', function() {
//change back to the front
    flipBoxInner3.textContent = "Joke Teller";
    }
);



## Issues and Resolutions

- Github presented me with a few challeges early on with push and pulls that were human error but caused delays in project plan  Npt heavy delays, just wasted time figuring it out. 
- Github pages didn't deploy and despite research on my own, unable to solve it.  Had to use a token to get help on this one. 
- Almost went a little crazt because of an extra curly brace in the CSS today.
